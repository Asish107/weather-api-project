# This file configures the pytest test runner for our project.
# The `pythonpath = .` setting is crucial for our project structure. It tells
# pytest to add the project's root directory (represented by '.') to Python's
# search path. This allows our test files in the `tests/` directory to
# correctly find and import our application code from the `app/` directory,
# solving potential `ModuleNotFoundError` issues.
